Carbyne Stack services, clients, and other components. The content is split into
two distinct dependencies. **Common-types** for public API signatures, as well
as other shared code and **common-testing** for utilities which are needed to
implement tests in Carbyne Stack in a desirable manner with JUnit argument
sources and AssertJ custom assertions.
